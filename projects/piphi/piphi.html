			<div id="headline">ANALYSIS<br></div>The NY Epsilon Chapter of Pi Beta Phi was in dire need of a major website redesign. Our website lacked the proper content to promote the benefits of Pi Phi and joining Greek Life when recruitment began each semester. The lack of control over our digital image meant we ran the risk of deterring potential new members, their parents, and the general public from any future interactions with our chapter.

			<div id="headline">OBJECTIVE<br></div>The goal of this redesign was for visitors to truly get to know the ins and outs of our daily lives: sisterhood, balancing commitment with academics, and the post-grad experience of being an alum. A combination of descriptive photos and texts would be needed to accurately portray the Pi Phi lifestyle.<br><br>
			Focusing our efforts on finishing the website by late August would give us an advantage over other RPI chapters who lack more readily maintained information while also grabbing the attention of the new freshman class arriving on campus in the next few weeks who had interest in joining greek life. <br><br>
			The additional focus on recruitment also solved a larger issue of lack of information availability about the entire process. Our aim was to not only educate but advise on how to tackle recruitment with ease. We hoped that by educating potential new members about the intimidating process, they would have the confidence to check out greek like and focus more on how they would fit in to each house according to their values, philanthropy interests, and comfort-level with sisters. <br><br>

			In terms of styling, we wanted to maintain a youthful and feminine tone that still had an underlying clean aesthetic. In order to achieve this aesthetic we emphasized styling consistency through a regulate set of typefaces of  and a color pallete of warm tans and golds with pops of accent colors for headlines. Most importantly, we were deliberate with the our content and headlines in order to welcome and spark enthusiasm rather than intimidate.
